# ‚ö°Ô∏è Breakdown

- Built with `React`
  - Functional components using hooks
  - Feature based folder structure
  - `common` directory for shared components
  - Bootstraped using `Create React App`
- Global state management via `Redux`
  - Follows the modular [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) proposal to bundle action types, creators and reducers all in one file
  - Flat state tree (avoids deeply nested properties)
  - Follows official Redux styleguide recomendations for naming actions and action types, e.g. `camera/photosFetched` vs `SET_PHOTOS`
  - Uses `thunk` middleware for async operations
- Type checked with `Typescript`
- Unit tested with `Jest` and `Enzyme`
- End-to-end tested in `Cypress`
- Custom component library showcased in `Storybook`
- Linted using `Eslint`
- Code is auto formatted using `Prettier` (ran as a pre-commit git hook) before it gets pushed to the repo

# üíø Installation

Run these commands in the terminal:

- `> git clone git@github.com:TowhidKashem/snapchat-clone.git`
- `> cd snapchat-clone`
- `> npm install`
  - This will:
    - Install the dependencies in package.json
    - Checkout [jeelizFaceFilter](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter_) package (used for filters) and set it to the last version this project was tested and confirmed to work with
    - Run `gulp` to concatenate, minify and transpile the files located in `public/filters/source/*.js` into a single file called `filters.min.js`
- This part is optional but strongly recomended, without it you won't be able to view any of the snap map features:
  - Make a Mapbox account and [get a free API key](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/)
  - Rename the `.env.sample` file at the root of the project to just `.env`
  - Inside enter your new API key, for example:
    - Before: `REACT_APP_MAP_BOX_API_KEY=<REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY>`
    - After: `REACT_APP_MAP_BOX_API_KEY=az.xyz123`
- `> npm start`
  - The app should open automatically in your browser at `https://localhost:3000/`
    - In Chrome you will receive a "Your connection is not private" error
      - Click "Advanced" > "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"

</p>

You'll get this warning because the app uses a self signed `https` certificate. The `getUserMedia` API used by the camera requires the `https` protocol so we run the dev server in https mode.

- After this you will be prompted to give access to your webcam, click "Allow"

- You're all set up!

# ü¶Æ Guides

Not all the buttons are actionable, many of them are there just for show since this is a minimal demo. The video at the top of this README shows all the things you can currently do.

Where it's not obvious which buttons actually work I added a red box-shadow as guide:

# üõ† Tooling

- The app has it's own component library and uses Storybook to showcase them. You can run Storybook using the command `npm run storybook`.

- The Redux Devtools Extension is implemented in the app, it makes things like viewing the state, state flow and debugging much easier, you can install the browser extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) or [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/).

# üß™ Testing

There are two types of tests in the app (end to end and unit).

## End to end tests:

- All e2e tests are located in `cypress/integration/*.spec.ts`
  - To run these use the command `npm run e2e`
  - This will spawn the Cypress electron app
  - Click "Run all specs", Cypress will spawn a Chrome instance and you will see all the tests as they're being run:

- üëá Click the image below to see tthe entire test suite being run:

  </a>
</p>

- Alternatively you can also run the e2e suite in the terminal using the command `npm run e2e-headless`. This command still generates videos in `cypress/videos/*.mp4` of the tests being run should you need them.

## Unit tests:

- All the shared components in the `common` directory have unit tests inside their respective folders. They end with a `*.test.tsx` extension.
  - To run the unit test suite use the command `npm run test` then enter `a` to run all tests
    - These tests are also automatically run on each commit, if there are any failures the commit will also fail
