==============================================

DONE:

zoom map in on open
filters
fonts
when picking new filter it needs to animate to the center capture button
open discover drawer, then open search drawer, them click discover drawer button and watch the flash, it shouldn't do anything when its already open
hit BE api to hide api keys
once u get the lat/lon, u can save it in redux to avoid the call in snapmap
cut videos to small seconds, for fairuse and performance
*** Fix wonkiness with filters
rename jeeFaceFilterCanvas
get rid of all the warnings in dev tools
404 page
skeleton frames on discover page
camera roll page
image download doesn't work on mobile
typescript errors and use of any
*** Add new filter
turn off eslint on filters dir
//@ts-ignore
when u run npm i at the root, can it also cd into filters dir and install all the deps there too? 
   add the jeeliz repo as a dep and have it installed via the npm i command in there too instead of committing the contents of that repo (yuck)
in chat the username color alternates on odd/even, it should be based on username
error moving down to field on chat message recived and enter
some type of walk through tool to show what's working (pulsing effect?)
give rounded edges to image cover
once video snap ends, can't be played again
removed `activeThread` functionality



NOT DOING:

loadable for all GET requests
immer.js
use map image for lazy loaded placeholder
bring back CSS modules?
is there a way to include imports globally e.g. the flexbox grid lib?
can we import just the parts of animate.css that we need?
share button?
`var` in filter index files
see if these (Optionnal init arguments) on https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter help with the red transition state
tap to close message on image snaps
add finger swipe navigation?
set initial state for all ducks
have compiled version of both the app and storybook for users who may run into npm issues (have both in build or dist folder)
in snapchat writing mulitple messages are touching lines
