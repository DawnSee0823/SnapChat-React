*** Fix wonkiness with filters
*** Add new filter

------

hit BE api to hide api keys

cross browser compatability / mobile

read and apply redux style guide rules

can we import just the parts of animate.css that we need?

bring back CSS modules?

`var` in filter index files

some type of walk through tool to show what's working (pulsing effect?)

add git repo link!

tap to close message on image snaps

is there a way to include imports globally e.g. the flexbox grid lib?

cut videos to small seconds, for fairuse and performance

use map image for lazy loaded placeholder

include storybook

pwa things like manifect, shortcuts, etc

remove tmp rules from tsconfig

once u get the lat/lon, u can save it in redux to avoid the call in snapmap

have compiled version of both the app and storybook for users who may run into npm issues (have both in build or dist folder)

in read me:

        one of the biggest factors in FE scalability is to keep things flat! in both folder strcuture and state tree
        <pic of redux dev tool and folder strcuture> with big x and check marks comparison

        folder strcuture based around features


renew all api keys in commits

use svg cleaner tool


const [PreviewMapComponent, setPreviewMapComponent] = useState<JSX.Element>();

// useEffect(() => {
//   (async () => {
//     const PreviewMap = await lazy(() => import('./PreviewMap'));
//     setPreviewMapComponent(
//       <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
//         <PreviewMap showDrawer={showDrawer} />
//       </Suspense>
//     );
//   })();
// }, []);


==============================================
