*** Fix wonkiness with filters
*** Add new filter

------

bring back CSS modules?

`var` in filter index files

some type of walk through tool to show what's working (pulsing effect?)

add git repo link!

tap to close message on image snaps

is there a way to include imports globally e.g. the flexbox grid lib?

cut videos to small seconds, for fairuse and performance

loadable for all GET requests

use map image for lazy loaded placeholder

immer.js

open discover drawer, then open search drawer, them click discover drawer button and watch the flash, it shouldn't do anything when its already open

include storybook

pwa things like manifect, shortcuts, etc

memory footprint neglagable:

in read me:

        one of the biggest factors in FE scalability is to keep things flat! in both folder strcuture and state tree
        <pic of redux dev tool and folder strcuture> with big x and check marks comparison

        folder strcuture based around features


renew all api keys in commits

use svg cleaner tool


const [PreviewMapComponent, setPreviewMapComponent] = useState<JSX.Element>();

// useEffect(() => {
//   (async () => {
//     const PreviewMap = await lazy(() => import('./PreviewMap'));
//     setPreviewMapComponent(
//       <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
//         <PreviewMap showDrawer={showDrawer} />
//       </Suspense>
//     );
//   })();
// }, []);


==============================================

DONE:

zoom map in on open
filters
fonts
when picking new filter it needs to animate to the center capture button
