*** Add new filter

skeleton frames on discover page

camera roll page

share button?

image download doesn't work on mobile

typescript errors and use of any

see if these (Optionnal init arguments) on https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter help with the red transition state

in chat the username color alternates on odd/even, it should be based on username, in snapchat writing mulitplee messages are touching lines

add finger swipe navigation?

when u run npm i at the root, can it also cd into filters dir and install all the deps there too? 
   add the jeeliz repo as a dep and have it installed via the npm i command in there too instead of committing the contents of that repo (yuck)

write end to end cypress tests

cross browser compatability / mobile
        check browser stack

read and apply redux style guide rules

`var` in filter index files

some type of walk through tool to show what's working (pulsing effect?)

add git repo link!

tap to close message on image snaps

remove tmp rules from tsconfig

include storybook

pwa things like manifect, shortcuts, etc

have compiled version of both the app and storybook for users who may run into npm issues (have both in build or dist folder)

renew all api keys in commits

use svg cleaner tool

block all readuests (especially external api calls) and confirm no error

const [PreviewMapComponent, setPreviewMapComponent] = useState<JSX.Element>();

// useEffect(() => {
//   (async () => {
//     const PreviewMap = await lazy(() => import('./PreviewMap'));
//     setPreviewMapComponent(
//       <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
//         <PreviewMap showDrawer={showDrawer} />
//       </Suspense>
//     );
//   })();
// }, []);


GRUNT WORK:

add more dummy snaps

You can use openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 120 -nodes to generate self-signed certificate and private key.

==============================================

DONE:

zoom map in on open
filters
fonts
when picking new filter it needs to animate to the center capture button
open discover drawer, then open search drawer, them click discover drawer button and watch the flash, it shouldn't do anything when its already open
hit BE api to hide api keys
once u get the lat/lon, u can save it in redux to avoid the call in snapmap
cut videos to small seconds, for fairuse and performance
*** Fix wonkiness with filters
rename jeeFaceFilterCanvas
get rid of all the warnings in dev tools
404 page



NOT DOING:

loadable for all GET requests
immer.js
use map image for lazy loaded placeholder
bring back CSS modules?
is there a way to include imports globally e.g. the flexbox grid lib?
can we import just the parts of animate.css that we need?
