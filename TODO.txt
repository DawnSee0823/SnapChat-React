*** Fix wonkiness with filters
*** Add new filter

------

write end to end cypress tests

cross browser compatability / mobile

read and apply redux style guide rules

bring back CSS modules?

`var` in filter index files

some type of walk through tool to show what's working (pulsing effect?)

add git repo link!

tap to close message on image snaps

is there a way to include imports globally e.g. the flexbox grid lib?
remove tmp rules from tsconfig
can we import just the parts of animate.css that we need?

include storybook

pwa things like manifect, shortcuts, etc

have compiled version of both the app and storybook for users who may run into npm issues (have both in build or dist folder)

in read me:

        one of the biggest factors in FE scalability is to keep things flat! in both folder strcuture and state tree
        <pic of redux dev tool and folder strcuture> with big x and check marks comparison

        folder strcuture based around features


renew all api keys in commits

use svg cleaner tool

block all readuests (especially external api calls) and confirm no error

const [PreviewMapComponent, setPreviewMapComponent] = useState<JSX.Element>();

// useEffect(() => {
//   (async () => {
//     const PreviewMap = await lazy(() => import('./PreviewMap'));
//     setPreviewMapComponent(
//       <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
//         <PreviewMap showDrawer={showDrawer} />
//       </Suspense>
//     );
//   })();
// }, []);


GRUNT WORK:

add more dummy snaps


==============================================

DONE:

zoom map in on open
filters
fonts
when picking new filter it needs to animate to the center capture button
open discover drawer, then open search drawer, them click discover drawer button and watch the flash, it shouldn't do anything when its already open
hit BE api to hide api keys
once u get the lat/lon, u can save it in redux to avoid the call in snapmap
cut videos to small seconds, for fairuse and performance


NOT DOING:

loadable for all GET requests
immer.js
use map image for lazy loaded placeholder
